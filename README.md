# dmm-res-sections (Debrid Media Manager Resolution Sections)

Chrome Extension for Debrid Media Manager that will Section Movies Based on their Resolutions and Versions.

## Examples (VERY ROUGH IMPLEMENTATION AND PROOF OF CONCEPT)

### Just wait 3 seconds on a movie page and boom.

This extension would break the native buttons and search functionality. I decided to remove the native sections and add a new custom one, that functions roughly enough the same so it would not crash client side.
